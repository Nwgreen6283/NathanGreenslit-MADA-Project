*Data Description*
Data was collected at 3 sites (Blind Oso, Canals, and Gulf) in Corpus Christi, TX starting on July 7th and ending on July 19th, 2022. Water samples were collected for inorganic nutrients, dissolved and particulate organic matter, and microbial analysis. Vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were obtained using a YSI ProPlus sonde. 

Variables include
`Temperature (Â°C)`
`Salinity`
`Nitrate`
`Phosphate`
`Copies/mL` : Produced using quantitative PCR. Provides gene copies of Vibrio bacteria
`Dust Concentration`

*Question that I am trying to answer*
How do Saharan Dust Events influence Vibrio populations in high nutrient coastal waters?

*Context to Question*

*How will I analyze it*
