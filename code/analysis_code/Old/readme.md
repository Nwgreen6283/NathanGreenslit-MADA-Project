This folder contains code to do some simple analysis on the processed/cleaned data.


There is a Quarto file which does some exploratory data analysis by creating a few tables and figures.

An R script does some simple statistical model fitting.

I'm only showing code here in way where the code is included in the Quarto file, and the R script is by itself and not combined with a Quarto file. 

As described in the `processing_code` materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it into a Quarto file.

So if I were to re-do this, I would have 2 R scripts that can run by themselves, and 2 Quarto files that pull in the code for easier combination of text and code.
I just haven't gotten around to writing them. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)
