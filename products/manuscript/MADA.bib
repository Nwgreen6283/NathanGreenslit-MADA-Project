  abstract = {Deposition of aerosolized desert dust can affect marine microbial community structure and function through pulsed addition of limiting micro- and macronutrients. However, few studies have captured responses to dust deposition in situ following trans-oceanic transport. We conducted a 26-d time series evaluating biogeochemical and microbial community response to Saharan dust deposition in surface waters in the subtropical western Atlantic (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, U.S.A.). Following periods of elevated atmospheric dust concentrations, particulate and dissolved iron concentrations increased in surface waters. Autotrophic picoeukaryote abundance increased rapidly, followed by increases in the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria and Synechococcus. Concomitant to cell count changes, we observed successional shifts in bacterial community composition. The relative abundances of Prochlorococcus and Pelagibacter declined with dust arrival, while relative abundance of heterotrophic bacteria increased, beginning with Vibrionales and followed sequentially by Chrysophyceae, Rhodobacteriaceae, and Flavobacteriaceae. Finally, a peak in Synechococcus cyanobacteria was observed. These results provide new insight into microbial community succession in response to Saharan dust deposition, their association with temporal dynamics in surface water dissolved and particulate iron concentrations, and a potential role for bioprocessing of dust particles in shaping marine microbial responses to deposition events.},

  abstract = {Generation time varies widely across organisms and is an important factor in the life cycle, life history and evolution of organisms. Although the doubling time (DT) has been estimated for many bacteria in the laboratory, it is nearly impossible to directly measure it in the natural environment. However, an estimate can be obtained by measuring the rate at which bacteria accumulate mutations per year in the wild and the rate at which they mutate per generation in the laboratory. If we assume the mutation rate per generation is the same in the wild and in the laboratory, and that all mutations in the wild are neutral, an assumption that we show is not very important, then an estimate of the DT can be obtained by dividing the latter by the former. We estimate the DT for five species of bacteria for which we have both an accumulation and a mutation rate estimate. We also infer the distribution of DTs across all bacteria from the distribution of the accumulation and mutation rates. Both analyses suggest that DTs for bacteria in the wild are substantially greater than those in the laboratory, that they vary by orders of magnitude between different species of bacteria and that a substantial fraction of bacteria double very slowly in the wild.},

Symptoms included complete erosion of tail, infection in the eye, mucous secretion and frequent mortality. A total of 540 strains were initially isolated in marine agar from different infected body parts and culture water sources. Subsequently 100 isolates were randomly selected, identified biochemically and all were found to be Vibrio harveyi-related organisms; finally from 100 isolates a total of 13 numbers were randomly selected and accurately identified as V. harveyi by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and species-specific PCR. Ribotyping of these strains with HindIII revealed total of six clusters. In vivo challenge study with representative isolates from each cluster proved two clusters each were highly pathogenic, moderately pathogenic and non-pathogenic. All 13 isolates were positive for hemolysin gene, a potential virulence factor. Further analysis revealed probably a single copy of this gene was encoded in all isolates, although not in the same locus in the genome. Although V. harveyi was reported to be an important pathogen for many aquatic organisms, to our knowledge this might be the first report of disease caused by V. harveyi and their systematic study in the sea bream hatchery from Malta.},

Vibrios occupy a variety of different niches, and each of these niches presents particular challenges for acquiring sufficient iron.               Vibrio               species have evolved a wide array of iron transport systems that allow the bacteria to compete for this essential element in each of its habitats. These systems include the secretion and uptake of high-affinity iron-binding compounds (siderophores) as well as transport systems for iron bound to host complexes. Transporters for ferric and ferrous iron not complexed to siderophores are also common to               Vibrio               species. Some of the genes encoding these systems show evidence of horizontal transmission, and the ability to acquire and incorporate additional iron transport systems may have allowed               Vibrio               species to more rapidly adapt to new environmental niches. While too little iron prevents growth of the bacteria, too much can be lethal. The appropriate balance is maintained in vibrios through complex regulatory networks involving transcriptional repressors and activators and small RNAs (sRNAs) that act posttranscriptionally. Examination of the number and variety of iron transport systems found in               Vibrio               spp. offers insights into how this group of bacteria has adapted to such a wide range of habitats.},

Another bacterium,               Vibrio coralliilyticus               , a well-known coral pathogen, has recently been shown to elicit mortality in fish and shellfish. Several strains of               V. coralliilyticus               , such as ATCC 19105 and Pacific isolates RE22 and RE98, were misidentified as               V. tubiashii               until recently. We compared the mortalities caused by two               V. tubiashii               and four               V. coralliilyticus               strains in Eastern and Pacific oyster larvae. The 50\% lethal dose (LD               50               ) of               V. coralliilyticus               in Eastern oysters (defined here as the dose required to kill 50\% of the population in 6 days) ranged from 1.1 \texttimes{} 10               4               to 3.0 \texttimes{} 10               4               CFU/ml seawater; strains RE98 and RE22 were the most virulent.

Results for Pacific oysters were similar, with LD               50               s between 1.2 \texttimes{} 10               4               and 4.0 \texttimes{} 10               4               CFU/ml.               Vibrio tubiashii               ATCC 19106 and ATCC 19109 were highly infectious toward Eastern oyster larvae but were essentially nonpathogenic toward healthy Pacific oyster larvae at dosages of {$\geq$}1.1 \texttimes{} 10               4               CFU/ml. These data, coupled with the fact that several isolates originally thought to be               V. tubiashii               are actually               V. coralliilyticus               , suggest that               V. coralliilyticus               has been a more significant pathogen for larval bivalve shellfish than               V. tubiashii               , particularly on the U.S. West Coast, contributing to substantial hatchery-associated morbidity and mortality in recent years.},

  abstract = {Most motile bacteria are able to bias their movement toward more favorable environments or to escape from obnoxious substances by a process called chemotaxis. Chemotaxis depends on a chemosensory system that is able to sense specific environmental signals and generate a behavioral response. Typically, the signal is transmitted to the bacterial flagellum, ultimately regulating the swimming behavior of individual cells. Chemotaxis is mediated by proteins that assemble into large, highly ordered arrays. It is imperative for successful chemotactic behavior and cellular competitiveness that chemosensory arrays form and localize properly within the cell. Here, we review how chemotaxis arrays form and localize in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. We focus on how the ParC/ParP system mediates cell cycle-dependent polar localization of chemotaxis arrays and thus ensures proper cell pole development and array inheritance upon cell division.},

The causative agent of the disease is Vibrio shiloi. The pathogen adheres to a {$\beta$}-galactoside-containing receptor in the coral mucus, penetrates into epithelial cells, differentiates into a viable-but-not-culturable form, multiplies, and produces a proline-rich peptide toxin that inhibits photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae in the presence of ammonia. Several of the virulence factors, such as adhesin, toxin, and superoxide dismutase, are produced only at the elevated summer seawater temperatures. The fireworm Hermodice carunculata is a winter reservoir and spring/summer vector for V. shiloi. The generality of the bacterial hypothesis of coral bleaching is discussed.},

The main objective of this review is to update the information regarding the ecology of Vibrio species, and contribute to the discussion of their potential risk in a changing environment. As heterotrophic organisms, Vibrio spp. live freely in aquatic environments, from marine depths to the surface of the water column, and frequently may be associated with micro- and macroalgae, invertebrates, and vertebrates such as fish, or live in symbiosis. Some Vibrio spp. are pathogenic to humans and animals, and there is evidence that infections caused by vibrios are increasing in the world. This rise may be related to global changes in human behavior (increases in tourism, maritime traffic, consumption of seafood, aquaculture production, water demand, pollution), and temperature. Most likely in the future, Vibrio spp. in water and in seafood will be monitored in order to safeguard human and animal health. Regulators of the microbiological quality of water (marine and freshwater) and food for human and animal consumption, professionals involved in marine and freshwater production chains, consumers and users of aquatic resources, and health professionals will be challenged to anticipate and mitigate new risks.},

  abstract = {A new emerging disease in shrimp, first reported in 2009, was initially named early mortality syndrome (EMS). In 2011, a more descriptive name for the acute phase of the disease was proposed as acute hepatopancreatic necrosis syndrome (AHPNS). Affecting both Pacific white shrimp Penaeus vannamei and black tiger shrimp P. monodon, the disease has caused significant losses in Southeast Asian shrimp farms. AHPNS was first classified as idiopathic because no specific causative agent had been identified. However, in early 2013, the Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory at the University of Arizona was able to isolate the causative agent of AHPNS in pure culture. Immersion challenge tests were employed for infectivity studies, which induced 100\% mortality with typical AHPNS pathology to experimental shrimp exposed to the pathogenic agent. Subsequent histological analyses showed that AHPNS lesions were experimentally induced in the laboratory and were identical to those found in AHPNS-infected shrimp samples collected from the endemic areas. Bacterial isolation from the experimentally infected shrimp enabled recovery of the same bacterial colony type found in field samples. In 3 separate immersion tests, using the recovered isolate from the AHPNS-positive shrimp, the same AHPNS pathology was reproduced in experimental shrimp with consistent results. Hence, AHPNS has a bacterial etiology and Koch's Postulates have been satisfied in laboratory challenge studies with the isolate, which has been identified as a member of the Vibrio harveyi clade, most closely related to V. parahemolyticus.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Atmospherically transported dust from the Saharan desert provides pulses of biologically important nutrients, including iron, to ocean surface waters. The biological response to these ephemeral events is not fully known, especially among the heterotrophic microbial community. Here we use the well-characterized               Vibrio               genus as a model for heterotrophic bacterial response. We demonstrate that Saharan dust nutrients, deposited in tropical marine waters, can promote               Vibrio               bloom formation and suggest that dust-associated iron is an important driver of               Vibrio               population dynamics. This work shows not only the role of fast-acting heterotrophs in the biogeochemical cycles of environmental pulses of iron, but it also highlights an important factor in the growth of bacteria that can cause disease in humans and marine organisms.                        ,                             Vibrio               is a ubiquitous genus of marine bacteria, typically comprising a small fraction of the total microbial community in surface waters, but capable of becoming a dominant taxon in response to poorly characterized factors. Iron (Fe), often restricted by limited bioavailability and low external supply, is an essential micronutrient that can limit               Vibrio               growth.               Vibrio               species have robust metabolic capabilities and an array of Fe-acquisition mechanisms, and are able to respond rapidly to nutrient influx, yet               Vibrio               response to environmental pulses of Fe remains uncharacterized. Here we examined the population growth of               Vibrio               after natural and simulated pulses of atmospherically transported Saharan dust, an important and episodic source of Fe to tropical marine waters. As a model for opportunistic bacterial heterotrophs, we demonstrated that               Vibrio               proliferate in response to a broad range of dust-Fe additions at rapid timescales. Within 24 h of exposure, strains of               Vibrio cholerae               and               Vibrio alginolyticus               were able to directly use Saharan dust\textendash Fe to support rapid growth. These findings were also confirmed with in situ field studies; arrival of Saharan dust in the Caribbean and subtropical Atlantic coincided with high levels of dissolved Fe, followed by up to a 30-fold increase of culturable               Vibrio               over background levels within 24 h. The relative abundance of               Vibrio               increased from {$\sim$}1 to {$\sim$}20\% of the total microbial community. This study, to our knowledge, is the first to describe               Vibrio               response to Saharan dust nutrients, having implications at the intersection of marine ecology, Fe biogeochemistry, and both human and environmental health.},

  abstract = {Vibrio is a cosmopolitan genus of marine bacteria, highly investigated in coastal and estuarine environments. Vibrio have also been isolated from pelagic waters, yet very little is known about the ecology of these oligotrophic species. In this study we examined the relative change in bacterial abundance and more specifically the dynamics of Vibrio in the tropical North Atlantic in response to the arrival of pulses of Saharan dust aerosols, a major source of biologically important nutrients for downwind marine surface waters. Aerosol and surface water samples were collected over 1 month coinciding with at least two distinct dust events. Total bacterial counts increased by 1.6-fold correlating with the arrival of Saharan dust (r = 0.76; p = 0.001). Virus-like particles (VLP) also followed this trend and were correlated with bacterial counts (r = 0.67; p = 0.01). Vibrio specific qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene ranged from below detection limits to a high of 9,145 gene copies ml-1 with the arrival of dust. This increase equated to 6.5 \texttimes{} 102-1.5 \texttimes{} 103 individual genome equivalents ml-1 based on the known range of 16S rRNA copies among this genus. Vibrio exhibited bloom-bust cycles potentially attributed to selective viral lysis or bloom depletion of organic carbon. This work is one of the few studies to examine the open ocean ecology of Vibrio, a conditionally rare taxon, whose bloom-bust lifestyle likely is a contributing factor in the flow of nutrients and energy in pelagic ecosystems.},
