## Dust for July

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "plots", "dust_july.png"))
```

**Dust AOD for month of July. Note slightly elevated dust levels prior to sampling period on the 5th. This may have impacted initial Vibrio levels on the 7th.**

## Distribution Tests (Q-Q Plots)

**A negative Lag value indicates that x is a predictor of y, or in this case, dust is a predictor of copies_mL- so we will be looking at these negative values. A positive ACF indicates a positive relationship between the two variables, where a negative ACF indicates a negative relationship. According to the ccf plots, BO has a significant lag relationship a value of -1. In other words, dust occurs, and one day later, we see a response in copies_mL. C2 has a lag at -2, and RD at -1**
